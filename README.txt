Most important files:
ens_util - the python script that generates all probabilities
brier_score_decomposition_benchmark - Benchmark model brier scores
brier_score_decomposition_ensemble - ensemble method brier scores
reliability_benchmark - benchmark reliability diagrams
reliability_weighted - ensemble method reliability diagrams
solar_simple_weightci - simple average solar forecast brier scores and reliability diagrams
solar_weighted_weightci - power weighted solar forecast brier scores and reliability diagrams

The *weightprob solar forecast files show the probability-weighted method of doing the solar forecasts.
We decided the CI-weighted method is appropriate instead, so these files can be ignored.
